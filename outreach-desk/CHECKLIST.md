# Outreach Desk — Post-Codex Verification Checklist

Run this after every Codex change to `outreach-desk/`. The detailed rules live in
`AGENTS.md` (§4 invariants) and `Jev_Scoring_Logic.md`; this is the quick pass/fail list.

## 1. Automated gate (must be green)
- [ ] `npm run verify` → `check` OK, all tests pass, **0 skipped** (baseline: 29 tests).
- [ ] `npm test` count has not silently dropped (a removed/weakened test is a red flag).
- [ ] No new `node_modules` / dependency added — `package.json` `dependencies` stays empty.
      (This project is deliberately zero-dependency, Node 24 built-ins only.)

## 2. Invariants (eyeball the diff — from AGENTS.md §4)
- [ ] **Loopback-only**: Host guard still rejects any non-`127.0.0.1` / `localhost` host,
      and validates against the server's actual bound port.
- [ ] **CSRF**: `requirePost` still enforces JSON `Content-Type` + matching `Origin`.
- [ ] **Response headers**: CSP / `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` / `Referrer-Policy:
      no-referrer` / `Cache-Control: no-store` unchanged.
- [ ] **Auth**: scrypt hashing + constant-time compare, min-10 password, session cookie stays
      `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Path=/`.
- [ ] **PII**: email redaction runs before any payload leaves to TypeSafe; `erase` still
      requires the literal `ERASE` token and wipes contacts, channels, notes, drafts,
      description, source, fitReview and jevFit.
- [ ] **Jev scoring**: one-record guard intact; an API failure throws (never becomes a low
      score); tier math and the C1–C4 anchors still match `Jev_Scoring_Logic.md` — including
      Iceland in the C1 top band and the 0.1 floors (C1/C2/C4) / 0.0 floor (C3).
- [ ] **Concurrency**: state writes still compare-and-swap on `revision` (409 on conflict).
- [ ] **Providers**: `redirect:'error'`, request timeouts, busy/lock guards, and credit floors
      (Firecrawl 105-credit reserve; LimaData >=1 credit) are preserved.

## 3. Runtime smoke (paths the suite can't fully cover)
- [ ] `npm start` boots; `GET /api/auth/status` → **200**.
- [ ] `GET /api/state` with no session cookie → **401**.
- [ ] Frontend loads. Optionally break one page builder once to confirm the fallback card +
      toast + Reload button appear, then revert. (No automated DOM harness exists by design.)

## 4. Hygiene
- [ ] Edits confined to `outreach-desk/`. The git root is the parent `codex-projects` tree —
      nothing outside `outreach-desk/` should be touched.
- [ ] No commit was created unless explicitly requested.

## How to use QoderWork for this
When Codex reports a change, paste its summary to QoderWork. It will run §1 and §3 directly
and diff §2 against the code, so the boxes above don't need to be checked by hand.
